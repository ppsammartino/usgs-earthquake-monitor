# Earthquake Search API

This directory contains the Django API service for the USGS Earthquake Monitor.

## Features
- Django + DRF for API endpoints.
- PostgreSQL for data storage.
- Redis for caching.
- Swagger UI for API documentation.

## Accessing Swagger UI

Once the API is running (usually at `http://localhost:8000`), open:
- `http://localhost:8000/swagger/` for the Swagger UI.
- `http://localhost:8000/redoc/` for ReDoc documentation view.

Both pages allow you to explore the available endpoints, parameters, and responses.

## Usage

Follow the steps in the main project `README.md` to set up, run, and interact with the API.
